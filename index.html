                            <h2>Nike <i> Revive </i> </h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A branded food heating device for mountain bikers.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Nike-page-11.png" alt="">
                            <p> The project brief was to design a Nike branded food heating device specifically for mountain bikers so they could refuel with a hot meal whilst on a ride. I started by <b> deconstructing the brand</b>. I looked at Nike's <b> values</b>, who their <b>customers are and aspire to be</b>, how the brand is perceived in the <b>media</b> and the <b>materials and shapes</b> commonly used in their products. <br> <br> I then looked into popular mountain biking brands and the experiences that people have when enjoying the sport. I also conducted <b> extensive user research </b> into people who enjoy mountain biking by conducting <b>interviews</b> and <b> online surveys </b> and reading <b>articles and blogs </b>, during which I gained insight into why people go mountain biking, what they typically take with them, how long they ride for and where they like to go. <br><br> The evidence of all the research conducted prior to and during the design can be found <a href="https://prezi.com/p0s_qmigcc6t/ids-2/">here.</a></p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Nike-page-12.png" alt="">
                            <p>I created a User Experience Scenario which is not an explanation of <i> how </i>the <b>persona</b> uses the product, but what they experience when they do. The scenario is based on the research I conducted regarding how Nike customers typically feel and want to feel when interacting with their products. For example, Nike products are often perceived to be <b>fashionable, foreword-thinking, high quality, powerful and victorious</b>. <br><br>The scenario depicts my persona setting out on a difficult and ambitious ride. He becomes tired and starts to struggle so he gets the Nike Revive device out of his backpack and <b>enjoys a hot nutritious meal in minutes</b>. Now he has the necessary energy to finish his ride and <b>feels victorious</b> for doing so. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Nike-page-13.png" alt="">
                            <p>I went through <b>many iterations</b> of designs, made <b>sketch models</b> and tested them on people for size and ease of use. The divide uses an <b>exothermic reaction</b> to heat the food. The materials I chose (HDPE and Silicone) had to be able to withstand high temperatures from the reaction, as well as survive any impacts that might occur on a ride.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Nike-page-14.png" alt=""><p>I designed a <b>mechanism</b> so water can be stored in the lid of the device and then released by sliding a switch, so the water falls down the central cylinder and reacts with the capsule at the bottom. Before their ride, the mountain biker loads the <b>stainless steel vacuum flask</b> with a pre-cooked meal of their choice, fills the cavity in the lid with water and then stores it in their backpack or car. When desired the user can activate the device and their food will <b>heat up in minutes</b>. At the end of use the capsule is unscrewed and discarded and can be replaced ready for next time.</p>

                            <h2>E.on Energy Save</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">An app to encourage families to save energy in the home by using gamification principles.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Portfolio Site Screenshots-08.png" alt="">
                            <p>The brief was to create an app for E.on to <b>encourage families to save energy in the home</b>. I started by researching and testing apps that use <b>gamification</b> principles and how they influenced <b>behaviour change</b>. I decided initially to use positive reinforcement in the form of <b>incentives</b> and <b>rewards</b> as well as <b>competition</b>.</p><br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/portfolio expanded text ai-25.png" alt="">
                            <p>My initial concept was to allow families to <b>compete with their neighbours</b> or other families in their area for the lowest energy usage per person and the most improved energy reduction, and gain rewards such as family days out for doing so. This was to <b>involve the children</b> of the family as they could compete with their friends. I found that when people know they are being compared to others they are more likely to want to look good and therefore be more conscious of their energy use.</p></p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/portfolio expanded text ai-26.png" alt="">
                            <p>When I presented my app concept to my original focus group there were some elements that they really liked which were having the ability to monitor their energy use over time and both the adults and children liked the rewards system. However the <b>didn’t like the concept of competing with their neighbours</b> as they thought it was <b>too personal</b> and an <b>invasion of their privacy</b>.<br><br>Instead they said that an app that stressed more on educating the family (especially the children) on ways to save energy e.g. turning lights off would be more beneficial to them.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/portfolio expanded text ai-28.png" alt="">
                            <p> Based on the focus group feedback I made some significant changes to the design. It is <b>now more focussed on educating and rewarding the family</b> for saving energy and less on competing with others- this makes a more family friendly yet still fun concept. The data page now contains <b>more details</b> on the household’s energy use in a way that is simple to understand.

                            <p>The quick-access screensaver allows the family to <b>see instantly whether they are above or below their tariff level</b>. If the globe is green then their “E.ons score” is above their tariff (saving energy) and if it’s red they are using more than they should be. The user page allows parents to monitor their children’s energy use more closely and make them more aware of the impact they have on the household. It can also be used to <b>switch off lights and appliances remotely</b>.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A sailing racecourse plotter and tracker.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Crew-page-16.png" alt="">
                            <p>This project is an exercise in experimenting with form and <b>human interaction with an interface</b>. I created a "<b>Form and User Board</b>" which inspired my sketches and helped me understand the <b>demographic and ethnography</b> of sailors. I wanted to use <b>complex curvature</b> in my design to evoke the movement of the sea.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Crew-page-17.png" alt="">
                            <p>Whilst developing my design I also had to <b>consider how it would be attached to the boat</b> when the sailor couldn't hold it, and realised that too much complex curvature would mean it many not be possible to do so securely. Therefore I went for a more subtle curvature by using <b>undercuts and changes in material and texture</b>. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Crew-page-18.png" alt="">
                            <p>I created a series of sketch models from card models to foam models to <b>experiment with the form and proportions</b> before I started on the final high fidelity model. To make the final model I cut out the general shape with a <b>band saw</b> and a hack saw, then used a combination of belt sanders and <b>hand tools</b> to refine it. I built up <b>layers of acrylic</b> around two sides so that I could slide the perspex screen underneath and cut a hole for the button.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Crew-page-20.png" alt="">
                            <p> I then sprayed the whole model with filler primer, let it dry, sanded it down the repeated several times. I masked off certain areas so I could achieve the two-tone effect with car <b>spray paint</b>, then added a logo using waterslide paper once it had dried fully. I created the <b>screen display</b> in Photoshop and then slotted it between the model and the clear perspex to create the final visual.</p>

<p>This video was released alongside the general availability of the product and is hosted on the <b>IBM Integration</b> Youtube channel  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQvT4kJoPTM">here</a>. We started by deconstructing the script (written by marketing) and split it into multiple scenes, before <b>sketching out storyboards</b> for each scene and how we could move between them. The scenes were then split up between myself and my two fellow interns and we began to make the assets on <b>Illustrator</b>, and then animated them in <b>After Effects</b>.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/video-sketches.jpg" width="80%"alt=""><br>
                            <p>Once each scene was roughly animated we <b>added the voiceover</b> to get the timings and scene changes exact. We went through <b>multiple iterations</b> of the script whilst working on the animations so had to be very flexible, and <b>scenes were cut and redrafted as we went along</b>. Finally I stitched all the scenes together in <b>Premier Pro</b> and added sound effects and scene transitions.</p>

                            <h2>KOKA</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A set of products for boiling, steaming and draining vegetables.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/koka-page-10.png" alt=""><p> The brief set by <b>Dunelm</b> was to design a product to enhance and improve cooking in the home, with <b>sustainability</b> at the centre of the design. I decided to scope the problem to people who live in <b>shared accommodation where space is limited</b>. I observed people in shared housing trying to cook over several evenings and found that one of the pain points for them was <b>limited hob space</b>, as if they were making a meal they might need <b>several pans for different vegetables</b>.</p><br><br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/koka-page-11.png" alt="">
                            <p>To solve the problem I designed a veg drainer inside which the vegetables are boiled within a pan, so many <b>different foods can be boiled in one pan</b>. It also allows for <b>both boiling and steaming</b> of veg depending on how much water is put into the pan. To drain the veg the drainer is simply lifted out of the pan and the water falls through the holes in the bottom. This means that the water can be used by another person using the kitchen and there is <b>no need for them to re-boil any water</b>. Alternatively several people can use one large pan at one time and remove their veg whenever it is ready.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/koka-page-09.png" alt="">
                            <p>The main body of the drainer is made from <b>Nylon</b> as it can be <b>injection moulded</b> and therefore produced relatively cheaply, and can also withstand very high temperatures. The grip is made from <b>Silicone</b> as it does not conduct heat and is malleable so will be comfortable for the user to hold.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/scott-page-12.png" alt="">
                            <p>The brief was to Design a new <b>carry case</b> to hold an <b>emergency breathing device</b>. It must be strapped to the body and allow the mouthpiece to be <b>donned in 30 seconds</b>. I started by determining the smallest footprint that would still fit the device inside securely and explored different possible orientations on the body.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/scott-page-13.png" alt="">
                            <p>When testing out different orientations on the body I found that the middle option would be the <b>most feasible</b> as when the catch is opened from the front <b>the product falls forward</b>, allowing it to be removed from the case and donned quickly.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/scott-page-19.png" alt="">
                            <p>I made models to illustrate the different options for the opening position and went through several iterations until I was happy with the way the <b>product was presented when the case was opened</b>.</p> <br><br><br>
